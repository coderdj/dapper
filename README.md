# Dapper Simple DAQ API
D. Coderre 5.10.2018

### Brief

I can barely take credit for writing this since all the functionality is implemented in Eve and all the stuff I had to do is straight from the examples. 

Requires eve and pymongo. API keys should be stored in the users database hashed with bcrypt (there is functionality in nodiaq for users to set this via web form). 

Runs test server with python run.py. Deploy instructions coming soon.
